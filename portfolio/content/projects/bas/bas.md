The Building Automation System (BAS) is a Full-Stack IoT Application developed to provide end users real-time control over their buildings via Web Browser. This system involves a network of smart devices that control and monitor a building's environment.

The Development Process:
- Program industrial IoT controllers/embedded systems using C to monitor and control IO and equipment behavior based on the environment.
- Architect the interconnectivity of the devices over various networks such as BACnet, CANbus and Niagara Networks (UDP/IP) and connect to the server.
- Once the device data is populated into the server, I develop the back-end using Java for additional algorithms and controls such as settings, alarming, user accounts, scheduling, database, etc.
- The front end UI/UX is developed via a mix of technologies including Niagara Framework's built-in editor, HTML and CSS.
- Smart Devices include: Delta, Samsung, and others.
- Controlled Equipment: Thermostats, HVAC Units, Lighting, Motion, Security, Alarms.

Research & Development:
- I am constantly upgrading internal custom built software modules to integrate with the latest Niagara releases and framework updates. This involves Java/Kotlin gradle development for the backend, while  UI/UX is utilizing Node.js
- These modules are then deployed to the team for use in their BAS Software Development.
