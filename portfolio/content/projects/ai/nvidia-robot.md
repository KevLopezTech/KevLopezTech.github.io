This project was a Live Demo and unfortunately does not have any images or videos.

The goals set for this project include Computer Vision and Self Driving. This was done via Camera, Sonar, Accelerometer, Gyroscope, and Motors. The robot was able to detect color and shape combinations on a sheet of paper, determine distance and detect objects for obstacle avoidance, move along a designated path, and estimate position in relation to the environment for localization.
