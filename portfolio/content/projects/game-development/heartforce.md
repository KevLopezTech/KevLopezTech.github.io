Heart Force is a complex 3d Unity game I am currently developing. The game consists of custom scripts I developed and integrating them with Unity's Frameworks and APIs to provide Scene Management, Character Selection, Main Menu, Gameplay Programming, AI Pathfinding and Combat, Input System, Weapon System, and more.
