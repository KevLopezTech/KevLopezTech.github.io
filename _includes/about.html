        <p>I am an extremely passionate Software Engineer with an extensive background in Embedded Systems, Game Development, and AI. I received my B.S. in Computer Science from Georgia State University in 2018.
        I am actively pursuing my M.S. as well. Currently, I am developing Building Automation Systems using using Tridium's Niagara framework and APIs.
        Outside of work, I enjoy researching new technologies and developing projects in different fields to strengthen my knowledge in the sciences.
        When I'm not at my computer, I enjoy playing the Tenor Saxophone and spending time with my dog.</p>
