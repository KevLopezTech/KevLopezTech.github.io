StellarDex is a mobile data repository where I developed a cross-platform mobile application using React Native, JavaScript, TypeScript, demonstrating robust API integration and implementing asynchronous data fetching from a large public RESTful API to populate a dynamic catalog of over 1000 unique entries. This project is currently under development and planned for deployment in the near future.
