This project primarily focuses on providing a Chat Bot that connects to a Discord channel via Discord APIs and providing a vast amount of functionalities such as moderation, conversations, and server management.

This project integrates to your own server. The bot is constantly communicating to Discord via WebSocket and responds with actions via RESTful APIs. A few commands and actions so far are message content filtering, management, music playback, and more.
